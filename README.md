# Jenre

## Manifesto!

Jenre is a simple music streaming app that allows users to choose playlists and see content relating to the song they are currently listening to. Along with lyrics and song information, users will see a stream of social media relating to the song. 

The following tools will be used:

* Rails
* Backbone
* jQuery
* Grooveshark API (access pending) 
* Tinysong API
* ChartLyrics API
* Twitter API

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate proficiency working with APIs and wiring up a Rails application with a Backbone frontend. Let's get to it!
